# is boto better than straight api calls?

Using boto3 is generally preferable to writing straight API calls for Cloudflare R2 (and other S3-compatible services) because:

- **Ease of Use:** boto3 provides higher-level abstractions and simpler method calls, allowing you to interact with R2 using familiar S3 methods (e.g. list_buckets, put_object) without manually handling HTTP requests, signing, and payload formatting.[^1][^2]
- **Error Handling \& Retries:** boto3 automatically handles common error scenarios, retries transient errors, and manages connection details for you, reducing boilerplate.
- **Feature Coverage:** boto3 supports almost all S3 API operations that R2 implements; anything not wrapped by boto3 can still be accessed via its lower-level client interface. For unsupported R2-specific features, you may need manual calls.[^3][^2]
- **Security:** boto3 uses well-tested, battle-hardened authentication flows; manual calls increase risk of mishandling credentials or making signing mistakes.[^2]
- **Community \& Documentation:** boto3 is widely used, well-documented, and integrated into many Python workflows for cloud data storage.[^4][^2]
- **Personal Preference and Special Requirements:** Some advanced users create custom APIs or use requests directly for special needs or unsupported features, but this is rare—boto3 is usually sufficient and much easier for most tasks.[^4]

In summary: **boto3 is the recommended approach for most developers as it’s more robust, easier, and less error-prone compared to handcrafting HTTP requests and handling S3 authentication yourself**. Manual API calls are only preferred if you're encountering a gap in API support or require special processing not feasible with boto3.[^1][^2][^4]
