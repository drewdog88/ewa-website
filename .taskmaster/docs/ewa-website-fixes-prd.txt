## Technical Requirements

### Environment
- Local development: Windows with Node.js and PostgreSQL
- Production: Vercel serverless functions with Neon PostgreSQL
- Database: PostgreSQL with proper schema and relationships

### Security Considerations
- Maintain secure authentication and authorization
- Protect sensitive data (PII, SSNs, contact information)
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for admin functions

### Testing Requirements
- Test all fixes locally before deployment
- Verify functionality on production environment
- Test with different user roles and permissions
- Ensure no regression in existing functionality

### Database Considerations
- Verify database schema integrity
- Check foreign key relationships
- Ensure proper indexing for performance
- Maintain data consistency

## Success Criteria
- All 9 critical issues are resolved
- Admin dashboard functions properly for all user types
- News and content management works correctly
- Volunteer management is functional
- Insurance forms can be submitted successfully
- All booster club cards display on front page
- Backup management is accessible and functional
- No new bugs introduced during fixes

## Implementation Approach
1. Investigate each issue systematically
2. Identify root cause and required changes
3. Implement fixes with proper error handling
4. Test thoroughly in local environment
5. Deploy to production and verify fixes
6. Document changes and update documentation

## Risk Mitigation
- Create database backups before any schema changes
- Test all fixes in isolation before integration
- Maintain rollback capability for each fix
- Monitor production logs for any new errors
