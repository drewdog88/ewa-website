# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create endpoints for officer CRUD, PII validation, and CSV import with duplicate detection.
# Details:
Implement GET/POST/PUT /api/officers and CSV import endpoint. Validate officer data (email, phone), never expose SSN in plaintext. Detect duplicates server-side. Assign officers to clubs with start/end dates and roles.
