# Task ID: 9
# Title: Integrate Structured Logging and Audit Trails
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up centralized logging for API requests, audit-critical actions, and error handling with correlation IDs.
# Details:
Use a logging library (e.g., Winston, Pino) to log API requests, errors, and critical actions. Mask PII in logs. Assign correlation IDs to requests for traceability. Store logs securely.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger API requests and critical actions, verify logs contain correlation IDs, and confirm no PII leakage. Test error logging and audit trails.
