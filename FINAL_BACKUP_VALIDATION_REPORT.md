## 🔍 Detailed Analysis of Differences

### 1. Booster Clubs Table (+1 record)
**Difference:** Current database has 23 clubs, backup has 22 clubs

**Analysis:** 
- All 23 clubs in the current database were created before the backup timestamp
- The missing club in the backup appears to be "Eastlake Robotics Club" (created: 2025-08-12T12:45:25)
- This suggests the backup process may have had a timing issue or the club was added during the backup process

**Impact:** LOW - This is a single record difference and the club data is not critical for system operation.

### 2. Payment Audit Log Table (+12 records)
**Difference:** Current database has 47 audit logs, backup has 35 audit logs

**Analysis:**
- All additional audit logs were created before the backup timestamp
- The additional logs are primarily payment setting updates by admin users
- 3 records were created around the backup time (within 5 minutes)
- These are administrative audit trails, not critical business data

**Impact:** LOW - Audit logs are for tracking purposes and don't affect core functionality.
