# MANDATORY 100% TESTING REQUIREMENTS

## **CRITICAL RULE: NEVER EVER CLAIM ANYTHING IS FIXED WITHOUT PROOF**

- **ALWAYS test locally first** before making any claims about fixes
- **ALWAYS test in production** after deployment before declaring success
- **NEVER say "should work" or "should be fixed"** without actual testing
- **NEVER push to production** without local testing first

## Required Testing Steps:

### 1. Local Testing (MANDATORY)
- Start local server: `npm start`
- Test the specific functionality that was broken
- Verify the fix actually resolves the reported issue
- Test with both PowerShell and WSL/curl commands
- Test browser functionality if applicable

### 2. Production Testing (MANDATORY)
- Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
- Test the same functionality on production site
- Verify the fix works in production environment
- Test both www and non-www domains if applicable

### 3. Before Making Any Claims:
- ✅ Local testing completed and working
- ✅ Production testing completed and working
- ✅ All reported issues resolved
- ✅ No new issues introduced

## Testing Commands:
```bash
# Local testing
npm start
# Test specific functionality
# Verify fix works

# Production testing
# Wait for deployment
# Test on https://www.eastlakewolfpack.org
# Verify fix works in production
```

## Consequences of Not Testing:
- Wastes user's time
- Breaks production builds
- Creates more problems than solutions
- Damages credibility

## Remember:
**"Should work" = "I haven't tested it"**
**"Fixed" = "Tested and verified working"**
**"Might work" = "I haven't tested it"**
**"Probably fixed" = "I haven't tested it"**
**"Should be working" = "I haven't tested it"**

## ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY:
- **NEVER** say anything is fixed without testing
- **NEVER** say anything should work without testing  
- **NEVER** make assumptions about functionality
- **ALWAYS** test every single change
- **ALWAYS** verify in both local and production
- **ALWAYS** prove it works before claiming success

## Testing Checklist (MANDATORY):
- [ ] Local server starts without errors
- [ ] Specific broken functionality tested locally
- [ ] Fix actually resolves the reported issue
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Production deployment completed
- [ ] Same functionality tested in production
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] User can verify the fix works

**ONLY THEN can you say "Fixed" or "Working"**
